    <p>
      Hey! My name is Devi Laxman, and I am from Leiecester. I currently work in Corporate Retail in Tech. In 2020, at the start of the pandemic I took a quick and short course on an introduction to coding via Future Learn. I found this course very intirguing and since then I have had a passion for coding :)
